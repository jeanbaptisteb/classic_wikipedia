# Classic Wikipedia
A Firefox add-on to get the classic Wikipedia interface back, pre-January 2023. 

The add-on can be installed from the following address: https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/classic-wikipedia/

# Bug reports
For any bug report or question, please add a request here https://github.com/jeanbaptisteb/classic_Wikipedia/issues or write an e-mail to classic.mode.wikipedia /at/ gmail.com

# Technical details
The extension automatically appends a `useskin=vector` parameter to any Wikipedia page URL you visit, and automatically reloads the page. For example, if you visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression, you'll be automatically redirected to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression?useskin=vector, which will show you the page with the classic Wikipedia interface.

# Privacy
You don't need to have a Wikipedia account to use this add-on. The add-on does not retrieve any information about you and never will. It just automatically redirects you to the classic version of Wikipedia pages, nothing more, nothing less. 

# Compatibility
This add-on is unlikely to be compatible with Firefox versions < 52.0.

# Roadmap
I do not plan to add additional features to this extension, but will fix reported bugs if possible. Pull requests are more than welcome relatively to that.
