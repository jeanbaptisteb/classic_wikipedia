<h2 >How to Get the Old Wikipedia Layout Back,
without creating an account</h2>

<div >
<div id="browser_badge">
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/classic-wikipedia/" title="Download and install the Firefox add-on"><img src="download_addon_wpc.png" alt="Add-on logo and link to the add-on"/ id="download_logo"></a>
</div>
<p>In January 2023, the <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2023/01/18/wikipedia-gets-a-fresh-new-look-first-desktop-update-in-a-decade-puts-usability-at-the-forefront/">Wikimedia Foundation started rolling out a new design</a> on the English version of Wikipedia, as well as on its sister projects. For various reasons, many Wikipedia readers and editors expressed their frustration with that. Fortunately, there are a lot of options to get the old interface back, without having to create an account on Wikipedia. </p>

<p>I've been developing a solution to this problem, initially for my own use, under the form of a Firefox add-on, "Classic mode for Wikipedia". You can very easily install it by following <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/classic-wikipedia/">this link</a>. You can also check <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/classic-wikipedia/reviews/">other users' reviews</a> before choosing to install it. 
<p>How to use it? <b>Just install the add-on, and any Wikipedia page you visit will now have the  "classic" look predating 2023</b>.</p>


<p>This is a non-commercial add-on, free, open-source, and without advertisement (and it will stay this way). The add-on also works with some other popular Wikimedia
websites: Wikimedia Commons, Wiktionary, Wikidata, Wikisource, and MediaWiki.</p>


<p>In order to work, when installing it, the add-on will ask your permission to access your data for Wikipedia and Wikimedia websites. Below is a screenshot of what the request pop-up should look like. Simply click the "Add" button the first time you install the add-on:</p> 
<img src="authorization.png" alt="Screenshot of when the add-on installation requests permission to access Wikipedia and Wikimedia websites data"/>

<p>Nothing to worry about, the add-on does not collect or send your data anywhere, it just needs to know when you are accessing a Wikipedia page, in order to offer you automatically the classic interface.</p>

<p>Below you will find additional information about it in case you are interested 
(features, contact information, privacy, license, etc.). I hope you will
find this add-on useful!</p>


<p>In case this add-on is not exactly what you're after, I listed a couple of other similar free and functional add-ons by other developers. The list is available <a href="#alternatives">just here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="features">Features</h1>
<div>
<ul>
	<li><b>It works automatically on all versions of Wikipedia</b>, no matter the language. No complicated configuration required, simply install the add-on and it works straight away!</li>
	<li><b>It works on several other Wikimedia projects</b>: Wikimedia Commons, Wiktionary, Wikisource, Wikidata, MediaWiki.</li>
	<li><b>It respects your privacy</b>. It is free, with no ads, no tracking, no data collection. It just offers you Wikipedia with its classic layout, nothing more, nothing less.</li>
	<li><b>Easy uninstall</b>: if you want the new Wikipedia/Wikimedia layout back, simply disable or uninstall the add-on.</li>
	<li>The code is published under a <b>free, open-source license</b>, and is publicly reviewable by anyone.</li>
	<li>It works with all versions of Firefox published after 2017.</li>	
	<li>Contrary to many other similar add-ons, it leaves <a href="https://nostalgia.wikipedia.org">Nostalgia Wikipedia</a> untouched. Nostalgia Wikipedia is a read-only copy of the English Wikipedia from December 20, 2001, with an even older layout than the "classic" one.</li>			
</ul>
</div>
<h1 id="privacy">Privacy and license</h1>
<div>

<p>The add-on is non-commercial, and does not collect or send any data anywhere (if it were the case, as a resident of the European Union, I would be forced by law to tell you that it collects your data).</p> 

<p>The add-on is published under the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/">Mozilla Public License Version 2.0</a>, which is a free, open-source license, guaranteeing that anyone can read and reuse freely the source code at any time.<p> 
<p>The code itself is pretty simple, and any developer or code-savvy people can easily check its content, safety, and features.</p>

<h1 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h1>
<div>

<p>Besides <b><a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/classic-wikipedia/">Classic mode
for Wikipedia</a></b> there are many other add-ons
for Firefox or other browsers to get the old Wikipedia interface back. 
</p>
<p>Here is a non-exhaustive list, as of January 24, 2023 (these add-ons may have been updated since): </p>

<ul>
	<li><b><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/old-wiki/cphagceemhgokfclmbnkpfkmchbfnclb">Old Wiki</a></b>. Supports many (all?) Wikimedia projects: Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, Wiktionary, Wikitravel, etc. It uses a very clean and safe code. Unfortunately it is not available for Firefox yet, but it supports many other browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave and Opera). Personal rating: 4.5/5</li>
	<li><b><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wikipedia-vector-skin/">Wikipedia Vector Skin</a></b>. Quite popular add-on. It uses a code similar to <i>Classic mode for Wikipedia</i>, and is also available for Firefox only. Unfortunately its scope is limited to wikipedia.org and mediawiki.org (e.g. it does not include Wikimedia Commons, Wiktionary, etc.), but it does its job very well with a clean and efficient code, and respects your privacy. Personal rating: 4/5 </li>
    
	<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wikivector/">wikivector</a>. For Firefox only. Scope limited to wikipedia.org. It does its job, but in a less efficient way than other add-ons. Personal rating: 2.5/5.</li>
	<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/legacy-skin-wiki/">legacy skin wiki</a>. Same shortcomings than <i>wikivector</i>. Personal rating: 2.5/5</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="author">Author info</h1>
<div>
<p>This add-on is a personal initiative, developed during my free time. I am not affiliated in any way to the Wikimedia Foundation, even though I am a sporadic anonymous contributor to Wikipedia.</p>

<p>As a completely unrelated thing, I am employed by the French National Center for Scientific Research, and work as a research assistant specialized in quantitative methods in a social sciences team. I co-authored a couple of publications that you can <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aaM9bk4AAAAJ&hl=en">easily find on Google Scholar</a> - but as mentioned before, they are completely unrelated to Wikipedia or Wikimedia, so you will have probably a limited interested in that.</p>

<p>I also have a couple of other free and open-source projects hosted on Github, that you can find <a href="https://github.com/jeanbaptisteb/">here</a>. They are too generally unrelated to Wikipedia or other Wikimedia projects, and are more on the side of research and publishing. But who knows, you might be interested! </p>
