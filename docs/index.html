<h1 >A Firefox add-on to Get the Old Wikipedia Layout Back </br>(without creating an account or other tedious configuration)</h1>

<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/classic-wikipedia/" title="Download and install the Firefox add-on"><img src="download_addon_wpc.png" alt="Add-on logo and link to the add-on"/ id="download_logo"></a>
</div>
<p>The <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2023/01/18/wikipedia-gets-a-fresh-new-look-first-desktop-update-in-a-decade-puts-usability-at-the-forefront/">Wikimedia Foundation decided recently</a> (January 2023) to roll out a new design on the English version of Wikipedia, called "Vector 2022". If you don't like it, you can simply fix the issue by installing this add-on I developed for Firefox: "<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/classic-wikipedia/">Classic mode for Wikipedia"</a>.</p> 
<p>The add-on is completely free and open-source, without advertisement, data collection, or anything like that -and it will stay this way. You can read some user reviews <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/classic-wikipedia/reviews/">right here</a>. </p>
<p>How does it work? Just install the add-on, and any Wikipedia page you visit will now have the  "classic" look predating 2023. No need to create an account. (If you're keen for more technical details, you can check <a href="https://github.com/jeanbaptisteb/classic_wikipedia">its source code</a>, or <a href="mailto:classic.mode.wikipedia@gmail.com">write me an email</a> with your questions.)</p> 

<p> The add-on will also work with some other popular Wikimedia projects, in case the Vector 2022 layout were eventually deployed on them: Wikimedia Commons, Wiktionary, Wikidata, Wikisource, and MediaWiki.</p>

<p>If this add-on is not exactly what you're after, I listed a couple of similar free and functional add-ons created by other developers. The list is available <a href="#alternatives">just below</a>. But I hope you will find my add-on useful! In any case, feel free to leave some general feedback on <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/classic-wikipedia/reviews/">the review page</a>.</p>
<p> If you have a more detailed feedback you want to share (bug report, feature request, etc), besides <a href="mailto:classic.mode.wikipedia@gmail.com">emailing me</a>, you can write a comment on the <a
href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/support-classic-mode-for-wikipedia/110245/2">dedicated thread</a> on Mozilla forums, or directly <a
href="https://github.com/jeanbaptisteb/classic_Wikipedia/issues">file a bug
report or feature request</a> on Github if you're familiar with that.

<p>Besides "Classic mode
for Wikipedia", there are many other add-ons
for Firefox or other browsers to get the old Wikipedia interface back. 
</p>
<p>Here is a non-exhaustive list, as of January 25, 2023 (these add-ons may have been updated since): </p>

<ul>
	<li><b><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/old-wiki/cphagceemhgokfclmbnkpfkmchbfnclb">Old Wiki</a></b>. Supports many (all?) Wikimedia projects: Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, Wiktionary, Wikitravel, etc. It uses a very clean and safe code. Unfortunately it is not available for Firefox yet, but it supports many other browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave and Opera). Personal rating: 4.5/5</li>
	<li><b><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wikipedia-vector-skin/">Wikipedia Vector Skin</a></b>. Quite popular add-on. It uses a code similar to <i>Classic mode for Wikipedia</i>, and is also available for Firefox only. Unfortunately its scope is limited to wikipedia.org and mediawiki.org (e.g. it does not include Wikimedia Commons, Wiktionary, etc.), but it does its job very well with a clean and efficient code, and respects your privacy. Personal rating: 4.5/5 </li>
    
	<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wikivector/">wikivector</a>. For Firefox only. Scope limited to wikipedia.org. It does its job, but in a less efficient way than other add-ons. Personal rating: 2.5/5.</li>
	<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/legacy-skin-wiki/">legacy skin wiki</a>. Same shortcomings than <i>wikivector</i>. Personal rating: 2.5/5</li>
</ul>

<p>This add-on is a personal initiative, developed during my free time. I am not affiliated in any way to the Wikimedia Foundation, even though I am a sporadic anonymous contributor to Wikipedia.</p>

<p>I also have a couple of other free and open-source projects hosted on Github, that you can find <a href="https://github.com/jeanbaptisteb/">here</a>. They are generally unrelated to Wikipedia or other Wikimedia projects, and are more on the side of research and publishing. But who knows, you might be interested! </p>
